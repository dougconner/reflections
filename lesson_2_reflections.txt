git init
is used to initialize a repository in a directory.
This command sets up the repository but does not make any commits.
Once I saved this new file, it shows up in the git status.
It still has no commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the respository?
What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is necessary when you have more than one file in the directory.
This lets you select which files will be added to the repository.
The working directory contains all the files.
The repository contains the committed files.
The staging area is where you define which files will go in the repository.
