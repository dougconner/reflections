When would you want a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
My first thought is for off-site backup in case my computer lost, stolen, or a disk crash.
A remote repository is necessary for working with other developers in a simple, organized way.
A remote repositry is the probably the best way to share work with the community.
Any solo work I want to remain private would probably stay local.
Private work with other would be a good reason to use a paid GitHub repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote?
It would be disruptive to have your local repository update automatically.
You could be in the middle of and edit to your code and have a new commit show up.
A new commit from the remote could have new things broken.

Describe the difference between forks, clones, and branches.
When would you use one instead of another?
Clones copy a repository from one location to another.
The source for a clone can be local or on GitHub.
Forks are for a GitHub to GitHub clone that keeps the reference to the source.
A fork provides proper attribution and reference to the source.
A branch is in the same repository as the source.
A fork should be used if the files will eventually show up on GitHub.
A clone is appropriate if the material will be kept locally.
Branches should be used for an experimental or temporary changes that will be merged.
