When would you want a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
My first thought is for off-site backup in case my computer lost, stolen, or a disk crash. 
A remote repository is necessary for working with other developers in a simple, organized way.  
A remote repositry is the probably the best way to share work with the community. 
Any solo work I want to remain private would probably stay local.
Private work with other would be a good reason to use a paid GitHub repository.
